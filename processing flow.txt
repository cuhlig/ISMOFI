Data processing steps

Methane oxidation rates from mass balance and isotope ratios

Example for HP Barrow data. Other concentration ranges and sample areas accordingly.

path incubations/Barrow/

1. merge SSIM files with SSIM log file (code not included, example of SSIM log file provided)

2. correct samples in low concentration range for isotope effect (code not included)

3. subset to separate samples & add additional information (salinity, headspace volume)
	-> bags.Barrow.R 
	
4. calibrate data, calculate headspace and dissolved concentrations, calculate k.ox
	-> calculations_Barrow_HP.R

5. summarize data for plots
	-> summarize_data_for_plots.R
